# HIV-Diet-Intervention

This repository includes analysis for a HIV diet intervention study conducted by Dr. Catherine Lozupone's Lab at CU-Anschutz Medical Campus. The study aimed to understand how agrarian diets high in fiber  over western diets high in fat, could allow for microbiome-diet matching to mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory disease in HIV infection. HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects were randomized to agrarian and western diets. Then, the 4-week study period included 2 weeks of prepared meals followed by self-feeding. At baseline (0-weeks), half-way through the study (2-weeks), and study completion (4-weeks), stool samples were collected for 16S sequencing, subjects reported dietary intake, and blood inflammatory and metabolic measures were taken. Additionally, at baseline and study completion, flow cytometry with cytometry time-of-flight (CYToF) mass spectrometry was used to analyze immune cell populations in blood and biopsy samples. 

This repository includes analysis of 16S microbiome data, metabolic and inflammatory measures, dietary data, and CYToF data.
